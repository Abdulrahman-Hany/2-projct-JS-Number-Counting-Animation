# Count Number Animation

This project is part of a series of small JavaScript projects aimed at enhancing my front-end development skills. This project features a **Count Number Animation** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The animation triggers when a specific scroll action is detected, creating an interactive and visually appealing experience.

## Features

- **Smooth Scroll Animation:** The counter starts animating once the user scrolls to the specified position.
- **Interactive Icons:** The icons are animated using the `icon-lordicon` library, adding dynamic visual effects.
- **Responsive Design:** The layout is fully responsive, ensuring the animation works across various devices and screen sizes.

## Scroll-Triggered Animation

As the user scrolls down the page, the counter animation is activated. The count-up animation consists of four boxes that contain numbers that count up to a certain end value. Each box also contains an icon and a title. This dynamic interaction enhances user engagement, providing a smooth and visually appealing experience.
